            <p class="nice">The data set used for the dashboard on this website is culled from the following database National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service (NGDC/WDS): Significant Earthquake Database. National Geophysical Data Center, NOAA.<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7289/V5TD9V7K">doi:10.7289/V5TD9V7K</a> </p>
            <p class="nice">The dashboard displays information on destructive earthquakes from 2006 to 2016 (with the exclusion of Haiti) that
        meet at least one of the following criteria: 10 0r more deaths and Magnitude 4.5 or greater.</p>
